## üîß Configuration

Update `src/main/resources/application.properties`:

```properties
spring.application.name=openbpm-spring-boot-sample

# H2 Settings
spring.datasource.url: jdbc:h2:file:./h2/camunda-h2-database

spring.h2.console.enabled=true
spring.h2.console.path=/h2-console

#Camunda 7 - embedded configuration

```

## üìÇ Process Definition

A test business process for requesting loan approval has been added to the project.

BPMN File: `src/main/resources/processes/approval-process.bpmn`

### Process Flow:
1. Filling with random data (Service Task):

   Automated generation of test data (first name, last name, phone, email) to simulate a loan application.

2. Data Validation (Service Task):

   Checks data completeness.
   
3. Data Verification (Service Task):

   Decision Logic:
   ‚ûî Credit score ‚â•70 ‚Üí approval.
   ‚ûî Credit score <70 ‚Üí rejection.

4. Notify about approval (Service Task):
   
   Automated approval notification

5. Notify about rejection (Service Gateway):

   Automated rejection notification
